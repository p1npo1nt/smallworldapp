# Small World App #


Our product aims to benefit customers who sell from within their homes and create strong local markets.

A summary: Small World helps home-owned businesses get out into the market. Sellers on Small World can create a profile, manage inventory, message buyers, and receive payment. Any buyer who uses Small World will be greeted with a selection of local sellers which are within commute distance. The buyer can change the radius to offer a more vast selection of sellers. 

A global issue: We live in a day and age of manufactured, processed, and unethically sourced goods. While these methods may lead to increased efficiency, they cut out smaller businesses and are unethical to both the consumers who consume them and the workers who made them. 

Our solution to this problem: Small World seeks to make locally and ethically produced goods as a staple in the everyday consumer's life. The seller would no longer be cut out by multinational distributors now that they can put themselves out into the market through Small World. The customer can utilize local, ethical goods that maybe cannot be found anywhere else.

Getting started: If you are a seller, simply sign up on the Small World app/website and create and name your Storefront. Once created, you can add images of your products, display your inventory to customers, set prices for your products, message buyers, and much more. If you are a buyer, again, sign up on the Small World app/website and simply begin shopping.

Customer quote:

“Small World helped me sell knit clothing from the comforts of my home. Through my Small World Storefront, I was able to view my income, manage my inventory, communicate with customers, and streamline the selling process as a whole. I also loved that you could add multiple locations so that I could sell from all different points of the city. The overall simplicity and user-friendliness of Small World guarantees that I will use this product for the foreseeable future.”
